At Mitchell, I developed programs in Fortran II on an IBM 1620 mostly to improve the efficiency of order processing and fulfillment.  Since then, all my jobs for the past 57 years have involved computer programming.  I am now a data scientist developing cloud-based big data fraud detection algorithms using machine learning and other advanced analytical technologies.  Along the way, I earned a Master’s in Operations Research and a Master’s in Management Science, studied artificial intelligence for 3 years in a Ph.D. program for engineering, and just two years ago I received Graduate Certificates in Big Data Analytics from the schools of business and computer science at a local university (FAU).  In addition, I currently hold the designation of Certified Analytics Professional (CAP).  At 74, I still have no plans to retire or to stop programming.</td>\n",

Sorry.&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m an average developer looking for ways to work as little as humanely possible.&lt;p&gt;The pandemic made me realize that I do not care about working anymore. The software I build is useless. Time flies real fast and I have to focus on my passions (which are not monetizable).&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I require shelter, calories and hobby materials. Thus the need for some kind of job.&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to ask my fellow tech workers, what kind of job (if any) do you think would fit the following requirements :&lt;p&gt;- No &amp;#x2F; very little involvement in the product itself (I do not care.)&lt;p&gt;- Fully remote (You can&amp;#x27;t do much when stuck in the office. Ideally being done in 2 hours in the morning then chilling would be perfect.)&lt;p&gt;- Low expectactions &amp;#x2F; vague job description.&lt;p&gt;- Salary can be on the lower side.&lt;p&gt;- No career advancement possibilities required. Only tech, I do not want to manage people.&lt;p&gt;- Can be about helping other developers, setting up infrastructure&amp;#x2F;deploy or pure data management since this is fun.&lt;p&gt;I think the only possible jobs would be some kind of backend-only dev or devops&amp;#x2F;sysadmin work. But I&amp;#x27;m not sure these exist anymore, it seems like you always end up having to think about the product itself. Web dev jobs always required some involvement in the frontend.&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any advice (or hate, which I can&amp;#x27;t really blame you for).</td>\n",

I know I shouldn&#x27;t think this way but it is hard not to. I&#x27;m very independent and I feel a pressure to &quot;show up.&quot; I will look into these opportunities mentioned and try to get in touch with some more members of the blind engineering community.   \n",

At Mitchell, I developed programs in Fortran II on an IBM 1620 mostly to improve the efficiency of order processing and fulfillment.  Since then, all my jobs for the past 57 years have involved computer programming.  I am now a data scientist developing cloud-based big data fraud detection algorithms using machine learning and other advanced analytical technologies.  Along the way, I earned a Master’s in Operations Research and a Master’s in Management Science, studied artificial intelligence for 3 years in a Ph.D. program for engineering, and just two years ago I received Graduate Certificates in Big Data Analytics from the schools of business and computer science at a local university (FAU).  In addition, I currently hold the designation of Certified Analytics Professional (CAP).  At 74, I still have no plans to retire or to stop programming.   \n",

Sorry.<p>I&#x27;m an average developer looking for ways to work as little as humanely possible.<p>The pandemic made me realize that I do not care about working anymore. The software I build is useless. Time flies real fast and I have to focus on my passions (which are not monetizable).<p>Unfortunately, I require shelter, calories and hobby materials. Thus the need for some kind of job.<p>Which leads me to ask my fellow tech workers, what kind of job (if any) do you think would fit the following requirements :<p>- No &#x2F; very little involvement in the product itself (I do not care.)<p>- Fully remote (You can&#x27;t do much when stuck in the office. Ideally being done in 2 hours in the morning then chilling would be perfect.)<p>- Low expectactions &#x2F; vague job description.<p>- Salary can be on the lower side.<p>- No career advancement possibilities required. Only tech, I do not want to manage people.<p>- Can be about helping other developers, setting up infrastructure&#x2F;deploy or pure data management since this is fun.<p>I think the only possible jobs would be some kind of backend-only dev or devops&#x2F;sysadmin work. But I&#x27;m not sure these exist anymore, it seems like you always end up having to think about the product itself. Web dev jobs always required some involvement in the frontend.<p>Thanks for any advice (or hate, which I can&#x27;t really blame you for).   \n",

I don&#x27;t study it religiously. I read it one time more than 10 years ago. I can only remember maybe a single specific anecdote from the book. And yet the simple idea that basically every action humans take can be traced back to an incentive has fundamentally changed the way I view the world. Can anyone recommend books that have had a similar impact on them?   \n",
